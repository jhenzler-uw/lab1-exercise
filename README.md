 **Prompt: What I Hope To Learn In Info 201**

*I hope to learn skills that will aid me in data visualization. I'm new to R coding, but I think it's really cool 
and fun, so I'd love to get better at it. I thought the work we did in with gitbash on the command line was also
interesting so I'd like to learn more about that. I think this class could aid me in becoming a better
problem solver in genneral, so I'm excited for that as well.*

***Main Things I'd Like to Learn***
- Data Visulaization 
- R Programing 
- Gitbash Command Line 
- Problem Solving
